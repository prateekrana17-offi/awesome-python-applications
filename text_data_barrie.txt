Sustainability Report introduction/ letter from Barrie: 

I am very pleased to present to you our latest sustainability report, encapsulating our ongoing efforts and achievements in driving sustainable practices across our organisation. At Motherson, sustainability is a guiding principle that permeates every aspect of our operations, from energy and water efficiency to waste reduction, from supplier engagement to biodiversity preservation, diversity, equity and inclusion to employee engagement. Within Motherson we are very clear that the responsibility for this lies with us all.  

As we move forward, our focus remains on being transparent about where we are, having clear ambitions for where we want to be and being accountable for taking this responsibility.  Guided by our stakeholder engagement process and the resulting materiality assessment, our commitment to sustainability extends well beyond compliance; it is ingrained in our DNA, continuously driving us towards a more sustainable and resilient future.  

We understand and are committed to addressing all the priorities that are important to us and our stakeholders across the full spectrum of topics under Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). Aligned with this, the pillars of sustainability to which we are committed and continue to intensify our efforts towards are:  

Governance: Fostering long-term growth in an ethical way, evolving from compliance to transformational governance.  

Planet: We are committed to helping preserve the planet through environmental stewardship, conserving resources, and reducing our ecological impact.  

People: We are dedicated to ensuring well-being and equitable opportunities for all, protecting human rights and providing a just transition for the people of Motherson.  

We are dedicated to integrating sustainable practices within all aspects of our business model and are continuously seeking to elevate our performance. We acknowledge that current   

geopolitical developments, economic pressures and uncertainty about the future present significant challenges, yet we maintain a focus on our sustainability strategy.  

A key part of our sustainability strategy is conducting materiality assessments. These assessments help us identify and prioritise the sustainability issues that are most important to our stakeholders and our business. By focussing on these critical areas, we align our efforts with the most significant impacts, enabling us to respond to challenges and opportunities effectively. This approach enhances our strategic direction and reinforces our commitment to transparency and accountability in our sustainability journey.

Barrie:
Hello, everyone. In April 2020, we started our sixth five-year plan. That was 36 billion on the top line with a 40% loss of costs. We also added four new verticals. I think it's a great time to have a midway update as to what's happening. To do this, we have a perfect plan. We're going to call it Route 36. With Route 36, we're going to try and show you what we are doing to achieve our targets of 2025.

But it's also necessary to understand why, what is the purpose of why we are doing this particular thing that we do every five years.
