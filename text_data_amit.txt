The Congress crushed the spirit of our Constitution several times for the sake of maintaining a certain family in power.   Indira Gandhi unleashed ruthless atrocities on the people of India during Emergency.  The yuvraj of the Congress party has forgotten that his grandmother imposed the Emergency and his father, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, on July 23, 1985, said in the Lok Sabha, taking much pride in this horrific episode, "There is nothing wrong with an Emergency”.  Mr. Rajiv Gandhi even said, “If any Prime Minister of this country who feels that an Emergency is necessary, under these circumstances and does not apply the Emergency, he is not fit to be the Prime Minister of this country.”  This very act of taking pride in a dictatorial act shows that nothing else is dear to the Congress other than the family and power.

Dominant display of team spirit.  Kudos to Team 🇮🇳 for the spectacular win, making it to the semi-final.  It was a truly well-played game where skipper Rohit rained runs, and Axar, Arshdeep & Kuldeep were exceptionally impressive.   Best wishes. Go get the 🏆. #INDvsAUS
